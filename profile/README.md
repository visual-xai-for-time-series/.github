# Visual Explainable AI for Time Series Classification

Visual Explainable AI for Time Series Classification establishing a framework for explainable artificial intelligence for time series deep learning models using attributions and counterfactuals.

## About

Deep learning models are often not applied to time series tasks as such models are not explainable or understandable. Visual explainable AI for time series strives to bridge the gap between state-of-the-art deep learning architectures for various tasks and explanations for such model decisions. The project will be divided into sub-projects published and worked on as a student thesis or as published conference papers.
