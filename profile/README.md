# Visual Explainable AI for Time Series

Visual Explainable AI for Time Series establishing a framework for explainable artifical intelligence for time series deep learning models using attributions and counterfactuals.

## About

Deep learning models are often not applied to time series tasks as such models are not explainable or understandable. Visual explainable AI for time series strives to bridge the gap between state-of-the-art deep learning architectures for various tasks and explanations for such model decisions. The overall project will be divided into sub-projects published and worked on either as student thesis or as published papers to conferences.
